A simple chess game created by Vivian Xu and Chris Trinh. Chess is a basic game that has been around for a while now, and we have recreated this game using java. It's a two player game that includes six different 
pieces with unique moves. Pawn the most simplest piece can only move one block up or two blocks up if it's its first turn. The rook which can move horizonally and vertically, however, if an allied piece is blocking it
that's the range that the rook is able to move. However, if it's the enemy piece blocking it, then the rook is able to "eat" it and take it off the board. This would apply to all the other pieces, where they're able
to take the enemy piece off the board if enemy piece is within the piece's area. Queens are able to move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Bishops are only able to move horizonally. The knight's move is often
described as "move like an L." This means that if the knight is currently on a white square, its L-shaped move will land on a black square, and vice versa. This unique move pattern allows the knight to move in a way 
that other pieces cannot, making it a valuable piece for strategic positioning and forking tactics in the game of chess. Lastly, the king, he can move one block each side, if your king is cornered and cannot move 
without being taken out, then the other player wins. So to play this game you would have to input the row and then the column of the piece that you want and then input the the row and column, basically the location 
of where you want to put the piece.
