Simple Chess Game
Introduction
This is a simple chess game created by Vivian Xu and Chris Trinh using Java. Chess is a classic game that has been enjoyed for centuries, and we've recreated it here for you to play on your computer.

How to Play
Starting the Game: Run the Main class to start the game. This will initialize a new chessboard and display it on the console.
Playing Moves: Players take turns to make moves. Enter the coordinates of the piece you want to move, followed by the coordinates of the destination square. For example, to move a piece from A2 to A4, you would enter 0,1 to selct your piece then 0, 3 to move your piece.
Piece Movement: Each piece moves in its unique way:
Pawn: Can move one square forward or two squares forward on its first move.
Rook: Moves horizontally or vertically, limited by any pieces in its path except when capturing an enemy piece.
Knight: Moves in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that direction, jumping over other pieces.
Bishop: Moves diagonally, limited by any pieces in its path except when capturing an enemy piece.
Queen: Moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, limited by any pieces in its path except when capturing an enemy piece.
King: Moves one square in any direction, but cannot move into a square that is attacked by an enemy piece.
Game End: The game ends when one player's king is in checkmate (unable to escape capture), or when there is a stalemate (no legal moves for the current player).
Winning: If a player's king is cornered and cannot move without being captured, the other player wins.
How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the Java files using javac *.java.
Run the Main class using java Main.
Example Move
To move the first pawn from the top left of the board to the third row, you would input 0,1 which selects the piece 0,3 to move the piece where you want.
